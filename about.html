            <h2>Our Origin</h2>
            <p>The AMA Foundation started with a simple yet powerful idea: to use the sport of basketball as a vehicle for positive change in young people's lives. Founded by a group of former players and passionate community members, we saw a need for a supportive environment where youth could develop their athletic skills while also learning crucial life lessons.</p>
            <p><span class="about-highlight">Inspired by community</span> and driven by a passion for youth development, AMA Foundation officially launched with a vision to provide high-quality training, mentorship, and competitive opportunities. We believe that every child deserves the chance to reach their full potential, and we are <span class="about-highlight">committed to every player's growth</span>, both on and off the court.</p>
            <p>Since our inception, we've grown from a small local initiative to a recognized organization, impacting hundreds of young athletes each year. Our journey is fueled by the dedication of our volunteers, the support of our community, and the inspiring potential we see in every child who walks through our doors.</p>
